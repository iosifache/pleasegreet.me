        <h1>The apathy of connecting with others online</h1>

        <p>We forget how polite we are when we meet someone new in person - we greet, say a few things about ourselves,
            learn a few things about the others, and hope to have an intriguing discussion.</p>

        <p>Our digital interactions have led us to believe that we are conversing with emotionless individuals. LinkedIn
            connection requests are a good example. We're sending them without an introductory note, or at best with a
            common phrase mentioning the "network building". However, the connections are not mere mentions of another
            name
            in our connections list, but rather a potential point of contact in the future.</p>

        <h1>A new approach</h1>

        <p>Begin to treat connection requests as if they were an actual meeting with the other person.</p>

        <p>Begin with a simple "hi!" If you've already spoken with that person - either in person or on another online
            platform - remind them of this. If not, please introduce yourself and explain why you sent the connection
            request. Make it personal, as you're not looking to connect with a random person on LinkedIn, but with a
            specific one.</p>

        <p></p>In this approach, the other person will understand why you're in their network: how they can help you and
        how
        you can help them. It increases the chances of the other person accepting you into their network and initiating
        a
        new chat on a topic you stated in your message.</p>

        <h1><code>pleasegreet.me</code></h1>

        <!-- Keep synced with the text from README.md -->

        <p><code>pleasegreet.me</code> is a short, <a href="https://github.com/iosifache/pleasegreet.me">open source</a>
            manifesto for those who believe in good LinkedIn
            connections. It simply
            clarifies why including a message when submitting a connection request may be advantageous to both you and
            the
            connected person.</p>

        <h2>Using the manifesto</h2>

        <p>Simply "sign" the manifesto by indicating in your bio that you follow the <code>pleasegreet.me</code>
            philosophy so that
            people who visit your profile are aware of your expectations when you receive a connection request:</p>

        <blockquote>Please introduce yourself briefly while sending a connection request. Consider "signing" the
            manifesto
            at <code>pleasegreet.me</code> if you have similar expectations from new requests.</blockquote>
